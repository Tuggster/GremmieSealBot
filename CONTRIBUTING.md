Hello, there! I'm glad you'd like to help out, but before you help out, please read this message.

I'd appreciate it if when contributing, you do not remove core features without reason,
or modify the main file (appv2.js) if you don't need to add some more support for modules, or fix big bad bugs.

Most of the work should be done in either the main module, or a new one.
